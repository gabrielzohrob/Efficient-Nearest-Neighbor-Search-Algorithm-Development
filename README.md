# Efficient-Nearest-Neighbor-Search-Algorithm-Development
In a computer science project, I developed optimized k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithms in Java. This involved designing efficient priority queues for high-dimensional data, conducting performance tests, and analyzing results to improve search speed and accuracy in large datasets.
